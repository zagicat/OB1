<h1 align="center">Open Brain</h1>

The infrastructure layer for your thinking. One database, one AI gateway, one chat channel. Any AI you use can plug in. No middleware, no SaaS chains, no Zapier.

This isn't a notes app. It's a database with vector search and an open protocol — built so that every AI tool you use shares the same persistent memory of you. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude Code, whatever ships next month. One brain. All of them.

> Open Brain was created by [Nate B. Jones](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/). Follow the [Substack](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/) for updates, discussion, and the companion prompt pack. Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cgh9WJEkeG) for real-time help and community.

## Getting Started

Never built an Open Brain? Start here:

1. **[Setup Guide](docs/01-getting-started.md)** — Build the full system (database, AI gateway, Slack capture, MCP server) in about 45 minutes. No coding experience needed. Or watch the [video walkthrough](https://vimeo.com/1174979042/f883f6489a) (~27 min).
2. **[AI-Assisted Setup](docs/04-ai-assisted-setup.md)** — Prefer building with Cursor, Claude Code, or another AI coding tool? Point it at this repo and go. Same system, different workflow.
3. **[Companion Prompts](docs/02-companion-prompts.md)** — Five prompts that help you migrate your memories, discover use cases, and build the capture habit.
4. **Then pick Extension 1** and start building.

**If you hit a wall:** We built a [FAQ](docs/03-faq.md) that covers the most common questions and gotchas. And if you need real-time help, we created dedicated AI assistants that know this system inside and out: a [Claude Skill](https://www.notion.so/product-templates/Open-Brain-Companion-Claude-Skill-31a5a2ccb526802797caeb37df3ba3cb?source=copy_link), a [ChatGPT Custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-69a892b6a7708191b00e48ff655d5597-nate-jones-open-brain-assistant), and a [Gemini GEM](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1fDsAENjhdku-3RufY7ystbS1Md8MtDCg?usp=sharing). Use whichever one matches the AI tool you already use.

## Extensions — The Learning Path

Build these in order. Each one teaches new concepts through something you'll actually use. By the end, your agent manages your household, your schedule, your meals, your professional network, and your career — all interconnected.

| # | Extension | What You Build | Difficulty |
| --- | --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 1 | [Household Knowledge Base](extensions/household-knowledge/) | Home facts your agent can recall instantly | Beginner |
| 2 | [Home Maintenance Tracker](extensions/home-maintenance/) | Scheduling and history for home upkeep | Beginner |
| 3 | [Family Calendar](extensions/family-calendar/) | Multi-person schedule coordination | Intermediate |
| 4 | [Meal Planning](extensions/meal-planning/) | Recipes, meal plans, shared grocery lists | Intermediate |
| 5 | [Professional CRM](extensions/professional-crm/) | Contact tracking wired into your thoughts | Intermediate |
| 6 | [Job Hunt Pipeline](extensions/job-hunt/) | Application tracking and interview pipeline | Advanced |

Extensions compound. Your CRM knows about thoughts you've captured. Your meal planner checks who's home this week. Your job hunt contacts automatically become professional network contacts. This is what happens when your agent can see across your whole system.

## Primitives: Concepts That Compound

Some concepts show up in multiple extensions. Learn them once, apply them everywhere.

| Primitive | What It Teaches | Used By |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- |
| [Deploy an Edge Function](primitives/deploy-edge-function/) | Deploying any extension as a Supabase Edge Function | All extensions |
| [Remote MCP Connection](primitives/remote-mcp/) | Connecting to Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Claude Code, Cursor, and other clients | All extensions |
| [Common Troubleshooting](primitives/troubleshooting/) | Solutions for connection, deployment, and database issues | All extensions |
| [Row Level Security](primitives/rls/) | PostgreSQL policies for multi-user data isolation | Extensions 4, 5, 6 |
| [Shared MCP Server](primitives/shared-mcp/) | Giving others scoped access to parts of your brain | Extension 4 |
